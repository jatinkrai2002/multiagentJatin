Extend the distributed multi-agent orchestrator 
into an enterprise-scale simulation with 
GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline and Docker deployment.

 This will show how you’d automate build, test, and deployment of the 
 orchestrator + agents into a containerized environment.



 GitHub Actions Pipeline Overview
The pipeline will:
    Trigger on pushes or pull requests to main.
    Build & test the Python orchestrator and agents.
    Build Docker images for orchestrator and agents.
    Push images to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).
    Deploy using docker-compose or Kubernetes (simulated enterprise-scale).

.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml


Enterprise-Scale Simulation
    Scaling agents: In docker-compose.yml, you can scale agents with docker-compose up --scale analyzer=3.
    Monitoring: Add Prometheus/Grafana containers to monitor agent health.
    Kubernetes option: Replace docker-compose with Helm charts for orchestrator + agents.


Interview Discussion Points
    Expected Answer: Candidate explains how CI/CD pipeline automates testing, builds Docker images, pushes to registry, and deploys orchestrator + agents.
    Challenges Faced & Resolved:
        Challenge: Secrets management for auth tokens.
            Resolution: Used GitHub Secrets (secrets.AUTH_TOKEN).
        Challenge: Ensuring orchestrator waits for agents.
            Resolution: Added depends_on in docker-compose and retry logic in orchestrator.
        Challenge: Image versioning.
            Resolution: Tagged images with commit SHA (:sha-${{ github.sha }}) for traceability.
